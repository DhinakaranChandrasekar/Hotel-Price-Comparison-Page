Introduction
Welcome to the Hotel Price Comparison project! This tool is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly interface for comparing hotel prices across different platforms, helping users find the best deals for their accommodations.

Project Overview
The Hotel Price Comparison tool leverages advanced web scraping techniques and data analysis to gather, compare, and present hotel prices from multiple sources. Users can input URLs from different hotel booking sites, and our tool will extract the relevant data, perform comparisons, and generate a comprehensive report.

Key Features
Multi-Source Comparison: Compare hotel prices from various booking platforms including iOL and RateHawk.
Real-Time Data Extraction: Fetch the latest prices and room availability in real-time.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy data input and result interpretation.
Excel Report Generation: Generate detailed comparison reports in Excel format for easy sharing and offline access.
Sequential Processing: Run multiple comparisons sequentially on the same file to track price changes over time.
How It Works
Input URLs: Users provide the URLs of the hotels they want to compare from different booking sites.
Data Extraction: The tool uses web scraping techniques to extract hotel data such as room types, prices, meal plans, and cancellation policies.
Comparison: The extracted data is compared to highlight the best deals and options available.
Report Generation: A detailed report is generated in Excel format, summarizing the comparison results.
Sequential Updates: Users can re-run the comparison on the same file, allowing them to keep track of price changes and updates.
Technologies Used
Python: For web scraping, data processing, and backend operations.
Selenium: For automating web browsing and data extraction.
Flask: As the web framework for the backend API.
React: For building the user interface.
Openpyxl: For Excel file manipulation and report generation.
